<td> 
	<p style="background-color:white;">My Story of Fireworks at Eid Night on 2015</p>
</td>
<p style="background-color:white;">The story began when on the night of the Hari Raya 2015, I played fireworks with my cousins in the village at night. At that time I only just want seeing people playing but my uncle pulled my hand to play fireworks together which is firecrackers das. Back then, I was really scared of fireworks but I still dared to play because this was my first experience in playing fireworks. But when I did have the firecrackers at the bottom I felt hot and I just assumed that was normal. The interval of a moment suddenly I did not realize what was happening, I only heard the sound of an explosion in my hand. At that time my voice did not sound and I cried and then I saw my hand was burnt black on the palm of the hand on the right. Then my grandfather scolded me for playing fireworks carelessly.</font>
<br>
<br><p style="background-color:white;">Then my mother who had just returned from the supermarket scolded. I regret what happened to me that night but it is a memory I will remember forever. On Eid the next day, of course I became the talk of my aunties and uncles, what happen in the last night is the story of Eid night that I will remember forever. The moral of the lesson I get is always be careful and remember that life and hands not have the second. That's all from me, thank you.</p>
